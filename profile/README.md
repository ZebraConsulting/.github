## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Zebra on GitHub.
Here you can find our internal projects and other useful general purpose code.

### Rules of conduct:
This is meant as guidelines for a good code experience
1. Create branches and pull requests.

  If you do a change, do it in a separate branch (not main) and create a pull request. This way it is easier to log changes and why they have been done.
  
2. Document the repository

  If you create a new repository. Please create a ReadMe-file that explains its purpose and how to use it.

### List of lookup libraries:
